- The CVL Single Digit dataset contains of 35,780 single digits (3,578 digits per class) written by approximately 303 various writers. The dataset consists of 10 different classes. The validation set may be used for hyper parameters validation and assessment but not for labeled or supervised training. 7,000 images (consist of 700 images or digits per class) of 67 writers are being chosen as training data. The validation set of 7,000 images (consist of 700 images or digits per class) is of equal size to training data with a dissimilar set of 60 writers. The test set contains 2,178 images per class ensuing in 21,780 testing digits of the remaining 176 writers. The Ô¨Ågures from the CVL Single Digit dataset were mined from these strings.
